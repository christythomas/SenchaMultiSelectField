This is an example Sencha Touch application with plugin.

In order to use this example you will need to place a touch directory into this directory.  

I used Sencha Touch 2.3.1.

This is a plugin for a text field that will popup a window with choices like you would see in the iPad email To field.

Requirements:

- dropdown with all the values sorted asc or desc
- typeahead filter of the values in dropdown 
- selecting an item removes the corresponding value in dropdown
- selected values appear in the form separated by commas
- the form field is expanded as needed if the list of selected values grows

1. by default the text area should be one line and should expand by height if the values don't fit in one line - the values should wrap 
2. prevent users from selecting the same contact many times (one way would be removing it from the list after selection) 
3. focus issues (on the iPad) should be fixed 
4. ability to type in a contact if it's not on the list 
5. functionality should be tested on both desktop and iPad and should be production ready quality
